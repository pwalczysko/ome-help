<p>
OMERO has a text-based search feature which allows you to search for data by name or other text associated with the data.
Other fields include description or annotations on the data such as Tags, Comments and Text-based File attachments.
More details on keyword searching are discussed after the walk-through steps below.
</p>

<p>The search functionality is identical in both the OMERO.insight and OMERO.web clients. The following steps can be applied to either client.</p>

<ol class="step">

<li>
<p class="first">
    Start a search by typing text into the search box at the top right of the window.
    Hit Enter to search. You will be taken to the main search page and the results will be dispalyed.
</p>

<p>You can also go directly to the main search in OMERO.insight by opening the Search pane at the left.</p>

</li>


<li>
    <p>
        You can browse your search results by selecting them in the table.
        Selected objects will be shown in the right panel.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you are on the main search page, you can further refine your search in a number of ways.
    </p>
</li>


<li>
    <p>
        Use <span class="bold">Wildcards</span> to broaden your search.
    </p>

    <p> -
        Use an asterisk <span class="bold">*</span> as a multi-character wildcard, either at the end of a word or the beginning
        E.g. mito* will match mitosis and mitochondria. *phase will match metaphase, anaphase, telophase etc.
    </p>

    <p> -
        Use a question mark <span class="bold">?</span> as a single-character wildcard. E.g. Aurora? will match AuroraA or AuroraB.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        Use the <span class="bold">AND</span> keyword to ensure that all results contain all keywords. E.g. GFP AND H2B will
        only return results that contain both GFP and H2B. Simply searching for GFP H2B will return results that contain
        GFP or H2B, although items that contain both will be ranked higher in the search results.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        Use the <span class="bold">Type</span> checkboxes to limit your search to specific types of Data.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        You can <span class="bold">Restrict the field</span> that you are searching for on each object.
        By default, OMERO will search on all fields that are indexed by the search engine. You can see
        the full list on the OMERO

            developers search page
        </a>.
        If you want to limit your search to the Name, Description or Annotations attached to your data,
        you can do this by selecting the relevant checkbox.
        Annotations include Tags, Comments and the Name and Contents of attached files.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        Specify the <span class="bold">Scope</span> of your search by choosing the Group that you want to
        search in and the Owner of the data. It is also possible to search across all groups or search
        for data belonging to all users.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        Choose a <span class="bold">Date</span> range to find data that was imported or created
        within a specified period. If you only choose a start date, the end date will be
        the current date. In OMERO.insight, you can also use this feature without specifying any Keyword in the Search line. This will return all data within the specified date range.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        Use an <span class="bold">ID number</span> of an image, dataset, project, screen or plate to find data according to their OMERO IDs. This search will always return image(s) with the appropriate IDs, irrespective of other search settings (like restriction to group or user) which you might have set.
    </p>
</li>


<h2>Keyword searching</h2>

<p>
    When OMERO adds data to it's search index, it processes the text and looks for keywords or 'tokens' to index.
    In general it does this by splitting text by any character that is not a letter or number.
    For example, an image name such as <span class="code-example">AuroraB-siRNAi_control_01.tiff</span>
    will be split into 5 tokens: <span class="code-example">AuroraB, siRNAi,
    control, 01, tiff</span>. This image will be returned by a search for any of those tokens, but will be ranked higher
    in the search results if multiple tokens are matched.
</p>
<p>
    For example, searching for: <span class="code-example">siRNAi AuroraB</span>,
    will find any images that have tokens of siRNAi OR AuroraB,
    but images that contain both these keywords will be returned ahead of other results. Searching for
    <span class="code-example">siRNAi AND AuroraB</span> will only match images that have both tokens.
</p>
<p>
    Search queries themselves are split into tokens as part of the search. Therefore, you expect to
    find an image named <span class="code-example">AuroraB-siRNAi_control_01.tiff</span> with any
    of the following searches:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="code-example">AuroraB siRNAi</span></li>
        <li><span class="code-example">AuroraB_siRNAi</span></li>
        <li><span class="code-example">AuroraB-siRNAi</span></li>
        <li><span class="code-example">siRNAi AuroraB</span> (Order is ignored for separate keywords)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
